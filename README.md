# A very own Netflix Clone!üìΩÔ∏è 

Guys, I being a newbie managed to create a [Netflix Clone](https://naughty-bardeen-1225fc.netlify.app/)!!!

   So the app , deployed using Netlify uses GraphQL to communicate with our database (using Datastax that is bulit Apache Cassandra) wherein data are stored according to Genres in the tables I have created.The clone is then fulfilled by creating a React‚öõÔ∏è app where we connect to the database, define our functions and design the front-end for the Clone.The app also uses Pagination and Slicing properties i.e it displays information in segments or page-by-page.I have used a custom movie dataset of few of my own favourites and the images on the movie info tiles are direct links from the [Imgur](https://imgur.com/).And due to the usage of custom movie images certain image ratios did not match with the others and a few movie info tiles seem distorted and there are also a few bugs (which will be taken care of :wink:), but <b>HEY!</b> I'm just starting :blush::grin:!!

I have <b><i> absolutely no</i></b> previous expereince in using any of the above , thanks:heart: to a ton of youtube tutorials and the stack overflow community for making this massive learning experience fun :confetti_ball: and possible.
